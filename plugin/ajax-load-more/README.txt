MAJOR UPDATE NOTICE
Ajax Load More can now use the WordPress REST API as the default for Ajax requests - this includes all add-ons and extensions.
Users that wish to continue using `admin-ajax.php` for Ajax requests can disable the REST API from  `Ajax Load More > Settings > Global Settings` in your WordPress admin.

For backwards compatibility, all users running WordPress version 4.7 or lower will default to using `admin-ajax.php`.
